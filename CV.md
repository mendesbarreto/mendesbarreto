## Professional Summary

With 14 years in software engineering, I’ve worked across the full stack, leading and mentoring teams that ship quality products. My focus is on delivering what clients actually need by collaborating closely with product and design and ruthlessly trimming down processes. This means practical agile, a strong focus on automation, and a culture of high quality.

I stay hands-on by architecting systems, managing migrations, and consulting. This keeps my skills sharp and helps me understand my team's challenges.

My goal is simple: build high-performing teams and scalable solutions that actually work.
